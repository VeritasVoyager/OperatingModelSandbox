It enhances market responsiveness and clarifies accountability by decentralizing operational authority to these distinct business units.",
    "description_long": "The Divisional Operating Model is primarily designed to manage the complexity that arises when an organization diversifies. By creating semi-autonomous divisions, each with its own P&L responsibility, the model decentralizes operational authority, allowing for enhanced focus and specialization. This structure is intended to improve market responsiveness within each division while the corporate headquarters retains strategic control over the overall portfolio and capital allocation.",
