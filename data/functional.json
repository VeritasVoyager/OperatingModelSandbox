It is primarily designed to drive cost leadership through efficiency, foster deep domain knowledge, and achieve economies of scale, making it ideal for stable environments where processes are well-defined.",
    "description_long": "The central strategic intent of the Functional Operating Model is to achieve operational efficiency and cultivate deep specialization. The organization is divided into departments based on common functions or areas of expertise, such as finance, marketing, and operations. This model is underpinned by key principles including the specialization of labor, a clear hierarchical chain of command within each function, and the standardization of processes to achieve economies of scale. It is primarily designed to solve the challenges of inefficiency and lack of deep expertise in less structured organizations, aiming to create a strategic advantage through cost leadership and functional excellence.",
